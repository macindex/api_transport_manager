This project was built as a knowledge test for the codeminer company, based on the instructions contained in the following repository: https://gist.github.com/talyssonoc/fa8094bc4f87ecee9f483f5fbc16862c#travels.

Based on the information presented in this project, the main aim was to build a relationship between the entities that made it up, so much of the time spent was spent building and designing it in the Ruby language, thus creating, reading, updating, editing and deleting at least one of the entities in the database.

The following image shows each of the entities that make up the database and their data types and relationships.

After downloading the project, we run the command inside its directory: 

##### bundle install

After installing the necessary dependencies, we run the server with the command:

##### bin/rails server

Finally, we run the requests using a tool such as insomia, postman or any other tool we feel more comfortable with.

As future improvements, we could check and validate users, make this application available on a server in production mode or even scale it on a treadmill, validating and testing the implemented code before making it available.
